ACCEPTING (TRUSTING) THE MTOR SELF SIGNED CERTIFICATE IN YOUR JAVA ENVIRONMENT 

=======
Windows
=======
1.
Figure out your JRE path with the command:
where java
This will return for instance C:\java\jdk1.6.0_37\bin\java.exe
The JRE path we are looking for in this case is C:\java\jdk1.6.0_37\jre

2.
Run this command to import the certificate to your keystore, password will be "changeit":
keytool -import -file <certificate path>\mtor.bhit.nl.crt -keypass changeit -keystore <JRE path>\lib\security\cacerts -alias mtor.bhit.nl


=====
Linux
=====

1.
Figure out your JRE path:
ls -la /usr/bin/java | grep java
If this points to /etc/alternatives/java, figure out where that symlink leads to:
ls -la /etc/alternatives/java
In most cases you will end up in the directory /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-oracle/jre/bin
The JRE path we are looking for in this case is /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-oracle/jre

2.
Run this command to import the certificate to your keystore, password will be "changeit":
sudo keytool -import -file <certificate path>/mtor.bhit.nl.crt -keypass changeit -keystore <JRE path>/lib/security/cacerts -alias mtor.bhit.nl
